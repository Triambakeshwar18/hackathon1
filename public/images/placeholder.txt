# Image Placeholders

This directory should contain the following images for your portfolio:

## Required Images:
- profile.jpg - Your professional headshot (300x300px recommended)
- about-photo.jpg - Additional photo for about page
- project1.jpg - Screenshot of your first project
- project2.jpg - Screenshot of your second project
- project3.jpg - Screenshot of your third project
- project4.jpg - Screenshot of your fourth project
- project5.jpg - Screenshot of your fifth project
- project6.jpg - Screenshot of your sixth project

## Image Guidelines:
- Use high-quality images
- Optimize for web (compress without losing quality)
- Use consistent aspect ratios
- Consider using WebP format for better performance
- Ensure images are properly licensed or royalty-free

## Fallback:
The website includes placeholder icons that will display if images are not found, so the site will work even without custom images.
